# OSY Practical Codes – Semester 5

This repository contains all the Operating System practical programs implemented in Python for Semester 5 of the diploma curriculum.  
It includes CPU Scheduling, Page Replacement, Deadlock Handling, and File Allocation methods.

## Contents

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** – Calculates Average Waiting Time & Turnaround Time.  
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)** – Non-preemptive scheduling.  
- **Priority Scheduling** – Non-preemptive priority-based scheduling.  
- **Round Robin (RR)** – Time-sharing scheduling with time quantum.  

### Deadlock Handling
- **Banker’s Algorithm** – Deadlock avoidance with Safe/Unsafe state detection.  

### Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO (First In First Out)** – Page replacement based on arrival order.  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** – Replaces least recently used page.  

### File Allocation Methods
- **Sequential File Allocation** – Demonstrates sequential allocation of files on disk.
