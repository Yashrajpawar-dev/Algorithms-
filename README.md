# Algorithms-
This repository contains the collection of Operating System (OSY) practical programs implemented in C/Python as per the diploma syllabus. The programs cover fundamental CPU Scheduling, Page Replacement, and File Allocation algorithms that form the core of Operating Systems concepts.
# OSY Practical Codes – Diploma Semester

This repository contains all the Operating System practical programs implemented in C for the diploma curriculum.  
It includes CPU Scheduling, Page Replacement, Deadlock Handling, and File Allocation methods.

## Contents

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come First Serve)** – Calculates Average Waiting Time & Turnaround Time.  
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)** – Non-preemptive scheduling.  
- **Priority Scheduling** – Non-preemptive priority-based scheduling.  
- **Round Robin (RR)** – Time-sharing scheduling with time quantum.  

### Deadlock Handling
- **Banker’s Algorithm** – Deadlock avoidance with Safe/Unsafe state detection.  

### Page Replacement Algorithms
- **FIFO (First In First Out)** – Page replacement based on arrival order.  
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** – Replaces least recently used page.  

### File Allocation Methods
- **Sequential File Allocation** – Demonstrates sequential allocation of files on disk.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashrajpawar-dev/Algorithms-.git
Navigate to the program file.

Compile and run the C program:

bash
Copy code
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
Note
All programs are written in a simple format with short comments for easy understanding and lab submission.

yaml
Copy code

If you want, I can **also make it even shorter**, fully minimal, so you can just paste it in the repo and it looks clean.  

Do you want me to do that?
